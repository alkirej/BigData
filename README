=======================
BIG DATA BOOTCAMP TASKS
=======================
This tree contains a directory for each task assigned during the Enhance I.T. 
BigData bootcamp that I took between Jan and Mar of 2020.  Each directory 
contains one task.  The directories are numbered and given a very short title 
aimed at making tasks as easy to find as possible.

=======================
Getting Started
=======================
Download (aka: clone) the repository and you should be ready to go.  You may
want to start with the installation of the hadoop infrastructure you will 
need in order for the tasks to run properly.  This is available in the
BigDataGroupProjects repository (task 2).

=======================
Prerequisites
=======================
Each task will require a different set of tools. See each task's README for
more information

For Example:

=======================
Installing
=======================
This "software" does not require installation. Hadoop and related tools will
need to be installed on a task by task basis.
