CAP THEOREM: aka: Brewer's theorem
    A distributed data store can only provide 2 of the following 3 attributes:
        Consistency         - every read receives the most recent write
        Availability        - every request receives a non-error response
        Partition Tolerance - system continues to operate despite dropped/delayed messages between nodes.
    
        C+P = RDBMS
        A+P = NoSQL db
        
    The CAP theorem implies that in the presence of a network partition, one has
    to choose between consistency and availability.
    
    CAP is frequently misunderstood as if one has to choose to abandon one of the 
    three guarantees at all times. In fact, the choice is really between 
    consistency and availability only when a network partition or failure happens; 
    at all other times, no trade-off has to be made.
