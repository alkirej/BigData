Task 
=============================
This assignment is to:
    1a- Create a list and fill it with 30 random numbers
    1b- Create method that returns the name, and id of the instance 
	of the object.
    2 - Given an unsorted integer array, find the smallest missing 
	positive integer.
	- Example 1: Input: [1,2,0] => 3
	- Example 2: Input: [3,4,-1,1] => 2 

    3 - what is the difference between `yield` and `return`
    4 - Remove duplicates from weekdays = [ ‘sun’,’mon’,’tue’, 
					    ‘sun’,’mon’,’tue’,
					    ’wed’,’thu’,’fri’,
					    ’wed’,’thu’,’fri’,
					    ’sat’
					  ]

    5 - Sql 
	Create a table for object you created above
	Insert into that table (1 record)
	Read all data from the table
	Delete the table

Return sample: call a function and print the result:
   THIS IS FUN!!!

Now, call a function that uses a for loop to build a
list using yield and returns the resulting list.
Print the returned list: 
Vector(20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96, 100)
