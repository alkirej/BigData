HBASE ARCHITECTURE
=====================================================================
1-HMaster  - lightweight process. assigns regions to region servers
                       to keep a BALANCED LOAD
    A- MANAGES and monitors HADOOP CLUSTER
    B- TABLE ADMINISTRATION ( create / update / drop )
    C- FAILOVER
    D- DDL -- & Any Schema Changes

2-Region Server - worker nodes here. Does read, update, delete for clients
    A- Has a Block Cache (for reading) READ CACHE
    B- Memory Store WRITE CACHE (one for each column family)
    C- WRITE AHEAD LOG (W.A.L.) - stores new unpersisted data
    D- HFile - storage file stores key-value pairs (K,V)

3-ZooKeeper - Distributed coordination service for region assignments
    A- Establish client communication with region servers
    B- Tracks server failure and network partitions
    C- Maintains configuration information
    D- provides ephemeral nodes (representing region servers)
