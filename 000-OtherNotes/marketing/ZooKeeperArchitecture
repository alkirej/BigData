---------------------------
ZooKeeper Election
---------------------------
A ZooKeeper election is when the server ensemble chooses a new leader
1-The main purpose of a topic leader is to ORDER CLIENT REQUESTS 
    THAT CHANGE THE ZOOKEEPER STATE
2-ZooKeeper state commands include create, setData, delete
3-Processors are either in LEADER or FOLLOWER state

----------------------------
ZooKeeper Election Process
----------------------------
A-zNodes represent a proposal by a client
B-the LEADER is the client with the smallest sequence # on its zNode

Steps:
------
1-All nodes create a sequential/ephemeral zNode
2-ZooKeeper appends a sequence number (10 digits in length) to
    the zNode
3-The node with the smallest sequence number becomes the LEADER
4-All other nodes become follower nodes
5-Each follower node "follows" (aka: "watches") the process with
    the next lowest sequence #.
6-If the LEADER process fails, its zNode is removed.
7-The processes follower node is notified of the failure
8-The follower node of the leader ensures there is not a zNode with
    a smaller number. It becomes leader of no smaller zNode is found
    or it makes the other zNode entry the leader
9-All other followers update their leader node with the new leader

ZooKeeper Terms
----------------------------
A-SESSIONS - facilitates FIFO communications with clients
B-WATCHES  - allows client to get zookeeper notifications about the cluster
C-ZNODES   - nodes in a zookeeper tree
D-NAMESERVICE       - maps a name to information
E-LOCKING  - uses mutexes
F-SYNCHRONIZATION   -
G-CONFIG MANAGEMENT - zookeeper can store and manage the configuration of 
                          our distributed system
H-LEADER ELECTION   - see above
I-ACCESS CONTROL (ACLs)
